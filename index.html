                <p>  A method I used at the Promises Promises workshop.  In order to fully understand an intervention or artifact, first investigate the object itself, what does it promise it’s user? Then, research the premise, how and why did this artifact (and its predecessors) come to be? Lastly, analyze the “postmise” Was this intervention or artifact successful? Why or why not? How could it have been better (or worse)?

                <p>A technique for designing artifacts and interactions around their expressive qualities.  By considering all the ways a given technology or digital artifact gets our attention, communicates information, and the ways we interact with it can help us to design artifacts that go beyond their basic functions and cause us to be more mindful when using them.</p>

               <p class="algn-lft">I realized this in a moment when we were really stuck with our third client project. We were trying to fill in a value proposition map in order to outline which features our platform should have and how exactly our solution would be beneficial to the citizens, but we kept getting stuck since our concept was still pretty vague and wasn’t detailed enough for all of us to have a useful discussion about these features since they weren’t quite concrete enough yet.  We decided to stop planning out and analyzing how our platform would be beneficial and to individually make wireframes of how we see this platform working.  After doing this, we were able to combine our ideas and create one unified wireframe that answered some of our questions, and enabled us to get better feedback from others.  The process of creating this helped us to unify our thoughts on the project more than the value proposition map would have. </p>

               <h3 class="centered tips-subtitle">Don’t Hesitate To Share your work </h3>
               <p class="centered">while this is something I’ve heard throughout my time in art school as well as the masters, it’s still something I have a hard time doing.  My perfectionistic self always wants to wait until something is very polished before presenting it to others, but during our critique sessions this year I began to feel less intimidated by discussing ideas that are still very rough, and I see the value more in receiving critical feedback early.  </p>

                <h3 class="algn-rt tips-subtitle">prototype in context, asap </h3>
                <p class="algn-lft">During our second project when we wanted to test our prototype in the coffee corner, we ran into a LOT of technical difficulties.  We had been mostly using our laptops to test the system, but ran into issues getting it to work properly when we tried to move the software to a RaspberryPi and an external screen.  Likewise, it was extremely difficult for us to hang our screen near our bin when it was at the coffee corner. If we had moved to thinking about and working with the prototype in its use context faster, we might have been able to overcome these issues.</p>

                <p class="algn-rt">Take inventory of the things that are around you, like team members’ skills, contact information of participants, data that has been gathered, and software/ tools.  Some of these things are easily taken for granted and analyzing what is available to you can help you see new possibilities for working around difficult situations. </p>

                <h3 class="centered tips-subtitle">Sometimes it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission </h3>
                <p class="centered">This year really taught me the value of doing guerrilla probes, as sometimes just putting something into the problem space and watching what happens to it gives really useful and unexpected insights. During our Sospeso project, we wanted to run a small probe in the cafeteria at lunch time in which we put color coded stickers on canteen disposables and matching posters on the trash bins to clarify the sorting process.  To do this, we needed to ask permission from the canteen staff, who were able to give us permission for the stickers but not the posters on the trash bins.  For this, we needed to ask facility services, so we went upstairs to ask facility services, who told us that we needed to ask at the front desk, who told us that we needed to ask the landlord, who wasn’t in, but we could call him… we eventually just decided to stick the posters on the bin and remove them and apologize if anyone got upset with us.  In the end, no one was bothered by the posters and we were able to run our probe.  We decided then, that if we could run probes that were easily removed and didn’t leave any lasting damage or marks on the school, we would just place them and apologize if issues arose.  By doing this we were able to run more experiments and gather more data than if we had always asked for permission and waited to be told it was okay to run our research activities.</p>

                <h3 class="algn-rt tips-subtitle">Play &amp; Pretend</h3>
                <p class="algn-lft">Magic Machines, Wizard of Oz, and speculative prototypes may not (technologically) work or even be feasible solutions to a problem space, but they are powerful tools for sparking a user’s imagination.  By presenting hypothetical artifacts or technologies to a user you can get valuable information about how they would interact with such a product.

                <h3 class="centered tips-subtitle">Pick your own stakeholders</h3>
                <p class="centered">During my first two projects, our primary stakeholder was our client, and I’d usually assumed the client’s needs to be the main focus of our project.  During our third project however, our problem space was much more complex and through our research, we found that our client wasn’t as directly affected by the outcome of our project as the citizens in the area could be.  Since the local citizens had the most to gain or lose, we decided to focus on them as our primary stakeholder, even if it upset our client.  Although I don’t think it is what they had in mind for the project, our client accepted our final concept, and I hope that it will make a difference somehow</p>
